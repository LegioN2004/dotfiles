<h1>üíª DOTFILES</h1>
These are my personal dotfiles for mainly my Arch-Linux machine 
</div>

---

- They are in this unusual dir order due to my symlink style configuration for using **GNU/STOW** in order to make my life easier since I am using version control to maintain and backup these stuff.
- I use **[GNU/Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)** to manage my dotfiles as well as keep track of them in GitHub using Git.
- Here I have a few configs of free and open source softwares as the directory names suggests
- I have gotten a lot of help while setting them up from StackOverflow; reddit pages like [r/neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/), [r/linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/), [r/linuxmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/), [r/archlinux](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/), [r/linux4noobs](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/), [r/linuxquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/); and Google.
- Copied a lot of stuff from the one and only [UNIXPORN](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/)

![one nvim pic](./assets/images/20230609_17h56m53s_grimedited.png)
<!-- ![second nvim pic](./assets/images/nvim-showed2.png) -->

- I use NEOVIM(a better version of vim, more appropiately a better fork) because it is one of the best editor I have ever used. I have configured it to my liking with all the keybinds ready to use so that my hands remain in the keyboard. There are still some extension left.
- Don't go for the exit vim memes, they're bluff. Use it to its full potential in its vanilla state and you will realise the power of vim, the legendary text editing abilities it provides. Start from here [freecodecamp.org/Vim-tutorial-for-beginners](https://youtu.be/RZ4p-saaQkc), then go for more improvements using channels like [ThePrimeagen][ThePrimeagen], etc.
- I have already setup formatting and linting(maybe) using the linters and formatters provided by mason from this [repo](https://github.com/leonasdev/.dotfiles).
- TODOS:
  - [ ] Configure DAP for java, cpp, and other languages to be used later on. 
  - [ ] make the ui better with the transparency and stuff.
  - [ ] setup formatting and linting for more languages.

### üòé The following are the legendary people of the Neovim users/community.
- **[ThePrimeagen][ThePrimeagen] is the legendary vimmer, he made me step into nvim/vim. One of the best channel, also twitches**.
- **[TJDevries](https://www.youtube.com/tjdevries) is another legendary vimmer, and the core maintainer of Neovim, has a great channel, also twitches**.
- **[Devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/devaslife) is the vimmer dev, he primarily uses nvim and I follow him a lot. His frontend and backend vids are amazing**.
- **The [r/neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/) reddit page, google helped of course**.
They helped me setup nvim like the one you see in the pics
